== Short description
Content analysis consists in collecting documents and getting insights from them by applying a systematic categorization scheme to them. The results obtained can help the researcher create a model, formulate hypotheses, and develop interpretative narratives about the content discussed in the documents.

== Key steps
- define a categorization scheme, in relation to your research question.
- select which documents to collect. These can be interviews, notes from an ethnography, press articles, social media content... it matters that the type of source and the rules that define which source to be collected, are defined in coherence with the research question.

- collect documents (conducting interviews, retrieving articles from a database...)
- organize and format documents, as needed. For instance, it will be convenient to transcribe your interviews before you analyze them. Visit the page on https://seinecle.github.io/methodology/generated-html/transcripts.html[free tools to transcribe interviews and any audio file].
- read the documents and apply your categorization scheme to it.
- iterate on the coding scheme while conducting the analysis, or after it, as necessary.
- synthetize results (eg, in a table) and do some simple checks and counts: did all categories of the categorization scheme apply to the content you collected? Do the documents check the categories in the same manner, or are there variations?
