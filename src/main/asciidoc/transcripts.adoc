== What is a transcript?
A transcript is the written version of the recording of a speech (monologue, interview, conversation...).
This implies that __you have properly recorded the interview__ - make sure the recording conditions are good enough! (quiet environment, etc.)

Every smartphone has a voice recorder function, just make sure the microphone is not obstructed.
Make also sure not to forget to launch the recording and to have enough batteries! 

A transcript should be exactly accurate, without any interpretation or modification.

Depending on the scientific discipline and goals of the transcript, there are different levels of precision of the transcript, up to to the inclusion of tones, noises and silences.

== Why do you need a transcript
