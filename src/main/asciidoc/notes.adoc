== First notes before synthesis
As the subject is quite daunting, I start here with notes as they derive from my train of thoughts, **without much structure**. I will organize them later.


=== In the classroom
My premise is that ChatGPT et al. are set to become technologies as pervasive as the Internet, emails and the web are today.

Does it follow that ChatGPT should be introduced in the classroom? After all, students don't do emails in class and that probably is as it should be.
