                <h1>The Seven Reasons Why You Are (Already) Missing the AI Turn</h1>
                <h2>by <a href="https://philippesilberzahneng.com/" target="_blank">Philippe Silberzahn</a>, professor at emlyon business school</h2>

                
                <p><i>This is an automated translation with GPT-4 of <a href="" target="_target">a blog post</a> published originally in French on November 13, 2023.</i></p>
                
                <p>The reasons why companies miss major disruptions are always the same, and they are at work with AI. Here are seven. Don't be fooled.</p>

                <p>Unless you've been living on Mars these past few months, you couldn't have missed the huge media buzz around the development of artificial intelligence (AI). This development is rapid, with each feat succeeding the previous one, with achievements that would have seemed impossible not so long ago. It is true that the world of technology tends to exaggerate the importance of its inventions, and some only last for a morning, but it can be said with some assurance that this is not the case with AI. After years of bubbling, its development has truly entered an exponential phase. Yet, despite often impressive results, many players remain on the sidelines. In my experience, there are seven reasons that explain this wait-and-see attitude, each corresponding to a well-anchored mental model. Let's examine these reasons to show how they are fallacious.</p>

                <h2>Reason #1 "AI will massively eliminate jobs".</h2> 
                <p>Behind this reason is the old fear that automation will eliminate jobs. However, this is <strong>not what is historically observed</strong>. Automation increases productivity, which lowers costs and allows for market development, which in turn fuels growth and the need for jobs.</p>

                <h2>Reason #2 "AI will replace humans."</h2> 
                <p>AI is a powerful tool that only works if it is well used. Humans have always used technology to do certain things better (productivity) and to be able to do new things (innovation). AI will not replace humans, but will find its full potential in the way humans use it. Those who will win are those who learn to use AI well, just as those who won in the past were those who mastered fire and arrow making.</p>

                <h2>Reason #3 "With AI, the less skilled will be left behind."</h2> 
                <p>On the contrary, AI is <strong>an opportunity for the less skilled</strong>. For example, it allows those who have not been able to learn a foreign language to get by with an automatic translator. It is a major factor in leveling the playing field for those who have not been able to pursue higher education. AI is like having 150 years of study in your pocket.</p>

                <h2>Reason #4 "AI is just a technology."</h2> 
                <p>Implying that it does not concern the general management who do not stoop to discuss technicalities. Big mistake. AI, of course, is a technology, but it would be a mistake to use it simply to serve what already exists to improve it. The right approach is to completely rethink one's profession, or activity, based on AI. Like the press twenty years ago asking, "What does it mean to be a newspaper in the Internet age when information is available for free on Google?" AI is a technology, yes, but of strategic importance.</p>

                <h2>Reason #5 "AI is not ready yet, it's better to wait..."</h2> 
                <p>No technology is ever ready. We have never waited for any to be so to use it. The automobile took years before it was more or less usable by the average person. Yet that didn't prevent it from being used with a very big impact. If you wait for AI to be "ready," assuming that is definable, it will be too late when you start using it.</p>

                <h2>Reason #6 "We don't really know how AI works, so it's dangerous."</h2> 
                <p>This is something you hear a lot, especially from moralists, who assume that something can only be used if it is perfectly understood. But this is false. Most human innovations have been intuitive, and we often only understood how they worked much later. Do we know perfectly how an investigating judge or an accountant works? No. And yet they are very useful. <strong>Lady Montagu</strong> spread the practice of variolation in the early 18th century, the precursor to our vaccines. She couldn't explain how it worked, but it worked and that's what mattered.</p>

                <h2>Reason #7 "I don't understand AI, I'll wait for things to become clearer..."</h2> 
                <p>Here the mistake is thinking that one can only understand something when everything becomes clear. However, for something as complex as AI (which is a field of multiple innovations in itself), this will never be the case. The only way to get an idea of what AI is, is to practice. And practicing doesn't just mean asking a question to ChatGPT and telling the result to your neighbors. Practicing means investing time to train on real cases, and thus be able to measure the strengths and weaknesses of the technology. This also allows one to better imagine the possibilities (see Reason #4).
                </p>

                <h2>Small Victories</h2>
                <p>As I recently said to an audience of experts concerned about the development of AI, it's not about stopping your activities and devoting yourself full-time to AI. It's about dedicating a little time to it, but in a systematic way. For example, asking one of the employees to become the "Mr. or Ms. AI" for a few hours a week. This time must be guaranteed by the general management and measured as an investment, not considered a leisure activity. It constitutes an acceptable loss: if it yields nothing, it's not a big deal because this time is limited from the start (but how could it yield nothing?). If it yields something, one can decide to invest more. This is done through small victories: one moves forward, builds something, but controls the risk by proceeding in small steps. Don't miss the turn of AI by falling into traps as old as time.
